                <p> Much has been said about the history of this City. In fact, the history for the conceptualization of
                    Harbourvale City Rapid Transit spans back to 2008!
                    The history is taken from <a href="https://gx3d.j37.com/forums/3146/topics/401987/"

                        rapid
                        system</u></h2>

                <p> In 2007, the government of Harbourvale City was convinced that they needed a new metro rapid system.
                    The roads were becoming increasingly congested and citizens complained of the terrible air quality.
                    Thus, the government saw the need of a straight line linking the northern part of the city to the
                    CBD. As a result, the Harbourvale Line began construction and was completed in 2008. The line was a
                    one-track system, due to space constraints and several other problems.

                <p> HCRT [Harbourvale City Rapid Transit] (then HRT) was allowed to operate the Harbourvale Line using
                    DMUs at that time. However, due to increasing congestion, the Harbourvale Line was rebuilt in late
                    2008 in order to allow for construction for more houses.
                </p>

                <p> In late 2008, sections of now unused tracks were abandoned and new tracks were laid to change the
                    direction of the line. Generally, the line did not change much. Several old platforms were still
                    utilised.

                    Airport Express Line)</h3>

                <p> After the opening of the new small airport, a short line was needed to connect the airport to the
                    rest of the rapid transit system. As a result, the HAEL was constructed. Train services ran from the
                    Airport and terminated at Chinatown. It was a branch line.

                <p> In 2009, the increasing population in the southern area of Harbourvale City forced the government to
                    extend the
                    line from Square Quays to Blackton Junction. Many services terminated at Square Quays and turned
                    back to serve the southern part of the line. Ridership increased too. With all these changes, as a
                    result, a new system map
                    was launched in 2010.

                <p> In early 2010, the government decided to tear down the whole line one last time and rebuild it
                    again. This was to allow for construction of elevated sections to allow for more "open" stations.
                    The government also allowed more special stations to be built. The designs of the stations were now
                    more diverse and unique. The line began to operate fully again in May 2010. Though this line was the
                    only line operating in HBV City, interchange details were made into the announcements to allow for
                    other lines.

                <p> As the eastern and western parts of the city grew, the government announced the Blackton Line to be
                    built and operated by HCRT.
                </p>

                <h3 class="mb-3" style="font-size: 25px; font-weight:bold ;">Evergreen Fields Line</h3>

                <p> Although HCRT was supposed to begin operations on this line by 2008, the line was abandoned due to
                    flaws in signalling and the land that the line was built on sank tremendously. HLRT (Harbourvale
                    Light Rail Transport) bidded for the new line and won the bid originally, but due to financial
                    problems (in reality, it's lack of time.), the line was given up to HCRT.

                <p> As there was a "blank spot" between City Line and Airport Express Line, the Coastal Sands Line was
                    supposed to help passengers get from Coney Island (Yes, you heard it. It's called Coney Island) to
                    East Harbour quicker. HMRT was awarded the line's tender.

                <p> There was not much a need to build this line, until Caroye began tremendous developement. HCRT was
                    awarded this line's tender. Construction has started. WTC is the official contractor of the line.

                <p> This line was supposed to serve the western district of the city, allowing an alternative for
                    passengers to transfer to the KS, BL and LR lines. HLRT was awarded the line's tender originally,
                    but due to financial problems (refer to above for the phrase meaning), the line was given up to
                    HCRT.

                <p> Much like the Circle Line in Singapore, this line is basically... a circle. However, due to
                    underdevelopement in several areas of the coastal areas, this line was cancelled.

                <p> As the design of the old map began to look dated, a tender was put up to redesign the system map.
                    TDC (Transport Design Consultancy) eventually won the tender. This also marked the first time HCRT
                    did a reorganization of operators, and halted several lines due to rising costs. These include the
                    City Line, and the cancelled Western Harbourvale Extension.

                <p> The LRT systems like the District LRT and Harbourvale City Light Rail (actually all LRT lines in
                    Harbourvale) were privatized, hence they
                    were not included in the official system map.

                <p> The first of its kind, the C100A is the very first train to be built specially for Harbourvale City.
                    With an orange stripe running through the whole length of the train, the train will run on the
                    Harbourvale Line. The seats are all the HCRT's livery, with orange being the front and back
                    carriages seats' colour, red being the second and fifth carriages seats' colour and black being the
                    two middle carriages seats' colour. 23 trainsets were purchased and is currently using ATS. These
                    trains were decommissioned from service after the acquisition by SMRT Virtual in 2020.

                        Upgrading, Replacement
                        Works</u></h2>
                <p> SMRTO was given the operational license extension of 9-years to operate the released maps - the HBL,
                    NWL & AEL. As the infrastructures such as the Full-Height & Half-Height Platform Screen Doors, began
                    to age, we
                    decided to replace both the fleets and the PSDs. The C651/A/B/C/Ds were decommissioned and replaced
                    by the new R151s, C151A/B/Cs. Announcements were also replaced for AEL and NWL, to standardize with
                    HBL's announcement format.
